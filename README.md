# Spore-Rich-Presence
A modded Discord Rich Presence solution for Spore - a 2008 life simulation real-time strategy God game.

## What is Rich Presence?
Discord's Rich Presence is a feature that enables users to display data related to the game they are currently playing. 
This is particularly useful for letting friends know what you're up to.
This modification will track the currently played game mode, and some of them may display additional information, such as Space Stage archetypes.
